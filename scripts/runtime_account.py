"""The service account step 9 builds and runs the app as: found or made, then
given its roles.

Cloud Run uses the project's default compute service account unless told
otherwise. That account is created when the Compute Engine API is first
enabled, so a project that never enabled it has no such account; and in a
project managed by an organisation the account is created with no roles,
since the org policy iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts withholds
the Editor role it used to get. Either way step 9 ends in PERMISSION_DENIED.

resolve(project) returns the default compute account, enabling the Compute
Engine API first when the account does not exist yet, since that is what
creates it. ensure_roles(project, sa) grants what is missing, idempotently.

Run: python scripts/runtime_account.py <project> [--check]
