"""The creator's memory - GEAP Agent Engine Memory Bank, in your project.

Memory Bank is long-term memory about a PERSON, scoped by user: it extracts
facts from conversations, consolidates them with what it already holds, and
hands them back by scope. Here the person is the creator, and the facts are
their taste and their standing rules:

    CREATOR_TASTE   which directions this creator picks, and how that moves
    CHANNEL_RULES   standing instructions the creator states

Two ADK callbacks connect it to the workflow (step 6), no new nodes:

    recall_taste   before_model_callback on propose_directions - reads the
                   memories and appends them to the model request
    remember_pick  after_agent_callback on scripter - writes what the creator
                   picked and shipped, so the taste keeps moving

Console:  python -m agent.platform.bank          create or connect the bank
          python -m agent.platform.bank load     seed the creator's history
          python -m agent.platform.bank list     what the bank holds

Documents belong in RAG Engine; a person's
preferences belong here.
