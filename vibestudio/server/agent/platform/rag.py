"""The audience's feedback - GEAP RAG Engine, in your project.

RAG Engine is retrieval over DOCUMENTS: you hand it files, it splits them
into passages, embeds each passage with an embedding model, and stores the
vectors in a managed vector store. A query is embedded the same way, and
the passages whose vectors sit nearest come back. Nearby vectors mean
similar meaning, so a comment about "the tiny dragon guarding one sock"
answers a query about "small magic in the kitchen" without sharing a word.

Here the documents are the audience's comments on the channel's past videos
(agent/comments.md), and the workflow reads them through one more node in
the research fan-out (step 7): read_feedback in agent/graph.py.

Console:  python -m agent.platform.rag                 create the corpus (once), or connect
          python -m agent.platform.rag load            upload agent/comments.md and the posters' captions; rerun after editing
          python -m agent.platform.rag load --caption  the same, with Gemini re-captioning agent/media/past/*.png first
          python -m agent.platform.rag load --audience the same, plus what the audience sent: every reader in
                                                       audience.READERS runs (voice, photos, clips -> text) and its file is uploaded
          python -m agent.platform.rag query "text"    the passages nearest to a question
          python -m agent.platform.rag list            the files in the corpus
          python -m agent.platform.rag reset           delete every file; the corpus stays

The corpus is a RAG Engine resource in your project. Its name is cached in
runs/ragcorpus.json; that file is the connection. A person's preferences
belong in Memory Bank (step 6); what people wrote belongs here.
