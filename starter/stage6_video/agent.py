"""Session 5 - video generation. The whole graph, with the desk: two branches and a join.

A Veo render takes minutes. render_submit (agent/desk.py) submits it and
returns a pending receipt; wrapped in LongRunningFunctionTool, that receipt
suspends the workflow at render_desk with the call's id in the session - the
same way direction_gate suspends it for YOU, with a form instead of a receipt.
Both suspended runs live in the session store and are resumed by id:
`python -m agent.deliver` answers the render's call id and the graph continues.

The poster takes seconds: make_poster (agent/graph.py) asks the image model
for the script's poster idea in the channel's style. Both branches leave
script_ready at once and meet at join_media, which waits for the slow one;
store_release keeps the pair.
