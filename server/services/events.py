"""The event bus behind /api/lab/events.

Subscribers hold an asyncio.Queue. Anything that changes the run (a worker
writing a file, a worker starting or exiting) is turned into a fresh snapshot
and published to every subscriber. A watcher task detects file changes by
fingerprint, so state written by worker subprocesses reaches the page without
the page polling.
