"""Make a save visible to the very next ADK run.

The mounted dev UI caches two things per app: the imported agent module and a
Runner built from it. With reload_agents=True, ADK's own file watcher evicts
both a moment after a file changes, but "a moment" is a few seconds on macOS
and a fast student can run before it fires. This module does the eviction
synchronously from the code API, so "saved" means "the next run uses this".

It also answers the question a student cannot otherwise settle: is adk web
running the code I just saved? Each Runner the dev UI builds is stamped with a
fingerprint of the sources it was built from; status() compares that stamp,
and the state of the imported modules, with the files on disk now.
